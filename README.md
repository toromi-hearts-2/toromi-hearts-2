a lot of people on this game don't know what did **actually** is. so, i've taken it upon myself to actually educate people as i'm tired of people treating it like it's the fictional character roleplay disorder.

<summary>What is DID?</summary>
  
> DID is a complex dissociative disorder that is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct identity states. It develops as the result of trauma occurring during a person's childhood **specifically** before the ages of 5-10. The role the trauma has in the development of DID is that it stunts the development of a central integrated consciousness. This, alongside disorganized attachment from caregivers and their denial of the traumas happening to the child causes the child to develop DID as a coping mechanism for their current situation.

<h2>DID vs OSDD</h2>

> OSDD-1, or other specified dissociative disorder subtype 1, is a dissociative disorder that develops like DID but is missing one of the main diagnostic features of DID. For example, OSDD-1a has parts or alters that are less distinct from each other, while OSDD-1b lacks significant amnesia. This, however, does not mean they don't experience amnesia. Someone with OSDD-1b could experience emotional amnesia, but not blackout amnesia.

> When comparing DID to OSDD-1, it's important to look at the theory of structural dissociation. Unlike DID, OSDD deals with secondary structural dissociation while DID deals with teritiary structural dissociation. The difference between secondary and teritiary structural dissociation is that secondary structural dissociation only has one ANP (apparently normal parts) and multiple EPs (emotional parts) while teritiary structural dissociation has multiple ANPs and EPs.

<h2>Other Things to note</h2>

> There are other subtypes of OSDD than just OSDD-1. OSDD-2,3,4,5,etc. are dissociative disorders with specific symptoms. These symptoms can be identity alterations due to brainwashing, acute dissociative reaction, dissociative trance, and Gasner's syndrome.

<summary>My stance on system discourse</summary>
  
I have a firm belief that endogenic systems are traumagenic systems that were mislead into believing they were endogenic by someone else. By Pluralpedia's definition, I would be an amni-endo. (don't take that seriously. I am firmly anti-endo and I enjoy making fun of Pluralpedia's stupidness.)
