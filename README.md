I've taken it upon myself to actually educate people on DID because it's obvious people don't know what it is or just blindly believe information on Carrds.

<summary>What is DID?</summary>
  
> DID is a complex dissociative disorder that is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct identity states. It develops as the result of trauma occurring during a person's childhood **specifically** before the ages of 5-10. The role the trauma has in the development of DID is that it stunts the development of a central integrated consciousness. This, alongside disorganized attachment from caregivers and their denial of the traumas happening to the child causes the child to develop DID as a coping mechanism for their current situation.

<summary>DID vs OSDD-1</summary>
  
> OSDD-1, or other specified dissociative disorder subtype 1, is a dissociative disorder that develops like DID but is missing one of the main diagnostic features of DID. For example, someone with OSDD-1 may have parts or alters that are less distinct from each other or may lack significant amnesia for a full DID diagnosis. This, however, does not mean they don't experience amnesia. Someone with OSDD-1 could experience emotional amnesia, but not blackout amnesia.

> When looking at OSDD-1 and DID, one of the crucial parts to look at is the types of structural dissociation associated with each disorder.

> Unlike other disorders that fall under secondary structural dissociation, OSDD-1 has more developed emotional parts (EPs). The EPs in OSDD-1 aren't as developed as those in DID, though. Another difference is that OSDD-1 lacks one of the diagnostic criteria for a DID diagnosis.
