Dissociative Identity Disorder is a complex dissociative disorder that **is caused by trauma before the ages of 5-6**. It can also be caused by disorganized attachment to caregivers.

**You do not have DID if**:
* Your symptoms are the result of a widely accepted religious practice.

* Your symptoms are because of substance use or another medical condition

DID is not a way to roleplay as your favorite characters nor is it something to flaunt. **Being traumatized shouldn't be flexed like a cool trophy you earned.** The amount of people that flex the fact they have this disorder is concerning especially coming from someone who *does* have this disorder. You wouldn't be flexing your trauma just out in the open, would you?

**You shouldn't want to have DID. You shouldn't want to be traumatized.** 

If you suspect you have DID, take your findings up with a licensed professional. Don't rely on other people's word of mouth to self-diagnose. If you do self-diagnose, only do it with the intention of improving your life and working on managing your symptoms. Don't do it as a fun and quirky thing.

# **Diagnostic criteria**
Some people seem to forget about DID's diagnostic criteria.

# **"DID is a personality disorder**
Take a look at the definitions of a personality disorder and a dissociative disorder. 

> "A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner
experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the norms and expectations of the
individualâ€™s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood,
is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment."

> "Dissociative disorders are characterized by a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the
normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation,
motor control, and behavior. Dissociative symptoms can potentially disrupt every area of
psychological functioning. This chapter includes dissociative identity disorder, dissociative
amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, other specified dissociative disorder, and
unspecified dissociative disorder."

DID is not a personality disorder. MPD, the old diagnostic name for DID, was never listed as a personality disorder in the DSM-III
