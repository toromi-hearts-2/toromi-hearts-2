He only wants to interact with a select group of people, and is usually against interacting with anyone outside of that group. 
Don't be upset if you don't get a response!

DID is not:
- The silly people in your head disorder
- Acting
- Roleplay

DID is a complex dissociative disorder caused by trauma before the ages 5-10. It isn't a means to roleplay as your favorite characters in media nor is it a way for your favorite characters to come to life. It's a disorder that has ruined my life, and is genuinely a pain to live with.

Stop using Carrds and social media for your information. They aren't verified medical sources. They aren't medical journals.

My alters only play this game to have something running in the background. **They have no intent on interacting with you unless you're in my PT party.**
