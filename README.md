Dissociative Identity Disorder is a complex dissociative disorder that **is caused by trauma before the ages of 5-6**. It can also be caused by disorganized attachment to caregivers.

**You do not have DID if**:
* Your symptoms are the result of a widely accepted religious practice.

* Your symptoms are because of substance use or another medical condition

DID is not a way to roleplay as your favorite characters nor is it something to flaunt. **Being traumatized shouldn't be flexed like a cool trophy you earned.** The amount of people that flex the fact they have this disorder is concerning especially coming from someone who *does* have this disorder. You wouldn't be flexing your trauma just out in the open, wound you?

**You shouldn't want to have DID. You shouldn't want to be traumatized.**

If you suspect you have DID, do your research and take your findings and symptoms to a licensed medical professional. Don't rely on word of mouth to diagnose you. That is armchair psychology.

# On Introjects:
Stop treating your introjects like their source. They aren't their source, and likening them to their source can only mislead people into thinking people with DID who have introjects are those characters IRL. Also, alters don't just develop for no reason.

# On endogenic systems:

**Endogenic systems are not valid systems.**

You're either faking it to make yourself seem special, or you've been misled into thinking your system didn't form as a result of trauma. The only thing that ever proves the existence of endogenic systems is, "trust me, bro." You are making DID into a trend, making it much more difficult for people, particularly children, to be diagnosed.

"You shouldn't downplay someone's lived experience!" Their experience has a direct impact on mine when they try to infiltrate the places of individuals who have been seriously traumatized and claim to have something these people deal with on a daily basis. DID is not a fun disorder, and I've ruined so many relationships simply by admitting to having it. If this doesn't convince you that endogenic "systems" have a direct impact on people with DID, I'm not sure what would.
