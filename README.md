did is **not** the "alter disorder" nor is it fun to have. it's a disorder for a reason, and you don't have it if:
* you don't have trauma (which is different than not remembering)
* the trauma you experienced did not happen before the age of 6-9
* you don't experience any form of dissociation
* ur symptoms are the result of religious practices or substance usage

did isn't something to flex and it shouldn't be romanticized as much as it is. 

alters aren't separate people and they are instead parts of your identity that didn't integrate properly during important developmental periods. treating them as if they're separate people in one body is incredibly misleading and unhealthy. alters make up **one** person.

acting like you're better than "singlets" is incredibly misleading as well. systems are basically singlets with a disorder and that's about it.

system accountability applies to the entire system and not just a few alters. you're accountable for *your* actions even if another part did it.

please actually learn about did before educating others. i hate how much misinformation is spreading around this game and it's making it hard for me to even come out about being someone with did.
