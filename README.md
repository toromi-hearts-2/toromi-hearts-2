![Before you interact, take into account that this person has DID. 
He only wants to interact with a select group of people, and is usually against interacting with anyone outside of that group. 
Don't be upset if you don't get a response!

DID is not:
- Roleplay
- Acting
- An excuse for your shitty actions
- A thing to flaunt or flex

DID is a complex dissociative disorder caused by trauma before the ages of 5 and 10. **It is not a way to roleplay as your favorite characters.** It's a disorder that has destroyed my life and is very painful to live with.

Stop using Carrds and social media for your research. You're only going to be misinformed. Additionally, stop relying on word of mouth to dictate if you might have DID or not. That isn't reliable, and you should do your own research.

**On Endogenic Systems**

You do not have DID or a system. You're either faking it to make yourself seem special, or you've been misled into thinking your system didn't form as a result of trauma. The only thing that ever proves the existence of endogenic systems is, "trust me, bro." You are making DID into a trend, making it much more difficult for people, particularly children, to be diagnosed.

"You shouldn't downplay someone's lived experience!" Their experience has a direct impact on mine when they try to infiltrate the places of individuals who have been seriously traumatized and claim to have something these people deal with on a daily basis. DID is not a fun disorder, and I've ruined so many relationships simply by admitting to having it. If this doesn't convince you that endogenic "systems" have a direct impact on people with DID, I'm not sure what would.
