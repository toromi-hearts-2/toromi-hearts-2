![Before you interact, take into account that this person has DID. 
He only wants to interact with a select group of people, and is usually against interacting with anyone outside of that group. 
Don't be upset if you don't get a response!

DID isn't the silly people in head disorder. It's a dissociative disorder caused by trauma before the ages 6-9 (or 5-10 in some instances.) Stop treating it as if it's a way for your favorite characters to come to life. Introjects aren't their source, and treating them like source is anti-recovery.

Stop using Carrds and social media for your research. Tiktok isn't a verified medical source, and Carrd isn't a verified medical source.
