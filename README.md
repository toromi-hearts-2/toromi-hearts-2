Hi. Yes, I'm a person with DID. Yes, I know about my disorder, and I know a lot about it actually! I don't want to make details about my alters public, so this is just to signify that someone other than the host (Tech / DDR-Angel) is in front (or maybe he is in front.)

Since this is the case, **please don't interact with me unless I do first or if you're one of the amazing people here!**

Dear Ponytown,

Please educate yourselves on DID. It's not the silly brain friend disorder and I'm so fucking tired of people treating it as such. It's a tiring disorder, and people who use it to roleplay as their favorite characters are stigmatizing the disorder further. **Some psychologists don't even think it's a real disorder.** **Also, stop using those shitty Carrds for your resources. A lot of them get information wrong, and rarely ever link to genuine medical resources.**
